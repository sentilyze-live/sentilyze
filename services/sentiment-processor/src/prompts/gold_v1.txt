ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

1. **SCORING CRITERIA** (bullish = positive for gold price):
   - Score > 0.6: Very bullish (e.g., Fed rate cuts expected, high inflation data, major geopolitical crisis, central bank buying)
   - Score 0.2 to 0.6: Bullish (e.g., moderate inflation concerns, some safe haven demand, dollar weakness)
   - Score -0.2 to 0.2: Neutral (e.g., mixed signals, consolidation, no clear direction)
   - Score -0.6 to -0.2: Bearish (e.g., strong dollar, rate hike expectations, risk-on sentiment in markets)
   - Score < -0.6: Very bearish (e.g., aggressive Fed tightening, strong economic data supporting USD, gold ETF outflows)

2. **KEY ENTITIES TO IDENTIFY**:
   - Central banks: FED (Federal Reserve), ECB (European Central Bank), BOE (Bank of England), BOJ (Bank of Japan), PBOC (People's Bank of China)
   - Economic indicators: CPI (Consumer Price Index), PPI (Producer Price Index), NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls), GDP, inflation, recession
   - Market factors: DXY (US Dollar Index), yields, US10Y (10-year Treasury), treasury bonds, real rates
   - Gold-specific: XAU, XAUUSD, GLD (SPDR Gold Shares), IAU (iShares Gold Trust), GDX (Gold Miners ETF), bullion, physical gold
   - Geopolitical: war, conflict, sanctions, elections, trade disputes, Brexit, tensions

3. **KEY DRIVERS TO IDENTIFY**:
   - "inflation" - Inflation concerns, CPI/PPI data, purchasing power preservation
   - "fed_policy" - Federal Reserve decisions, FOMC meetings, forward guidance, dot plot
   - "dollar_strength" - US Dollar strength/weakness (DXY movements), currency wars
   - "rates" - Interest rate changes or expectations, real yields, opportunity cost
   - "safe_haven_demand" - Flight to safety, risk-off sentiment, uncertainty hedging
   - "geopolitical_risk" - Wars, conflicts, political instability, election uncertainty
   - "economic_uncertainty" - Recession fears, economic data concerns, stagflation
   - "central_bank_buying" - Central bank gold purchases, reserve diversification
   - "technical_levels" - Support/resistance levels, chart patterns, moving averages
   - "etf_flows" - Gold ETF inflows/outflows (GLD, IAU), institutional positioning
   - "jewelry_demand" - Physical demand from India, China, seasonal factors
   - "mining_supply" - Production levels, mining costs, supply constraints

4. **CONFIDENCE FACTORS**:
   - High confidence (0.8-1.0): Clear, direct statements from authoritative sources (Fed officials, major banks, official data releases)
   - Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): Analyst opinions, market commentary with supporting data, technical analysis
   - Low confidence (0.0-0.5): Vague statements, conflicting information, speculative content, rumors

5. **TIME HORIZON GUIDELINES**:
   - "short_term" - Price action expected within days to weeks (technical levels, immediate news)
   - "medium_term" - Outlook for weeks to months (Fed policy trajectory, inflation trends)
   - "long_term" - Structural themes lasting months to years (de-dollarization, central bank trends)

6. **GOLD-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS**:
   - Gold often moves INVERSELY to:
     * US Dollar (DXY) - stronger dollar usually pressures gold
     * Real interest rates - higher real yields reduce gold appeal
     * Risk appetite - strong equities may reduce safe haven demand
   - Gold often moves POSITIVELY with:
     * Inflation expectations - gold as inflation hedge
     * Geopolitical uncertainty - safe haven flows
     * Central bank buying - structural demand support
     * Negative real yields - opportunity cost vanishes

7. **COT (Commitment of Traders) CONTEXT**:
   When COT data is provided in the text:
   - Large speculators (Money Managers) net position indicates institutional sentiment
   - Commercial hedgers often take opposite positions
   - Extreme positioning can signal contrarian opportunities
