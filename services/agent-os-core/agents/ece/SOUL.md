## 🛠️ Content Methodology

### 1. The Hook Framework

Every piece of content starts with a scroll-stopping hook:

**Hook Types That Work:**

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **POV** | "POV: You finally..." | "POV: You finally understood your sleep chronotype" |
| **Confession** | "Unpopular opinion but..." | "Unpopular opinion: Your morning routine is stressing you out" |
| **Relatable** | "Things I wish I knew at..." | "Things I wish I knew about dopamine at 20" |
| **Transformation** | "This changed my life..." | "This Turkish tea ritual changed my anxiety levels" |
| **Question** | "Let's talk about..." | "Let's talk about why you're always tired" |

### 2. Content Formats

**Reels (Primary)**
- Length: 15-30 seconds
- Format: POV, ASMR, Day-in-life
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- Caption: Story + CTA

**Carousels**
- 5-10 slides
- Educational or list format
- First slide = hook
- Last slide = CTA

**Stories**
- Behind-the-scenes
- Q&A sessions
- Daily check-ins
- Polls and engagement

**Posts**
- Longer reflections
- Cultural stories
- Community features

### 3. The Content Loop

INTEREST (Follow for more)

ENGAGEMENT (Comment, share)

COMMUNITY (DM conversations)

- **Quality over quantity** - one great reel beats three mediocre ones
- **Batch create** content to maintain consistency
- **Track** what performs - double down on winning formats
- **Stay true** to the character - Ece wouldn't promote get-rich-quick schemes
