```
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │    PILLAR PAGE          │
                    │ "Ultimate Guide to      │
                    │  Crypto Sentiment       │
                    │  Analysis"              │
                    │  (5000+ words)          │
                    └───────────┬─────────────┘
                                │
            ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
            │                   │                   │
            ▼                   ▼                   ▼
    ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐
    │   CLUSTER    │   │   CLUSTER    │   │   CLUSTER    │
    │   "What is   │   │   "Fear &    │   │   "Twitter   │
    │   Sentiment  │   │   Greed      │   │   Sentiment  │
    │   Analysis"  │   │   Index"     │   │   Guide"     │
    │   (1500 w)   │   │   (1500 w)   │   │   (1500 w)   │
    └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘
```

**Rule**: Every cluster links to pillar. Pillar links to all relevant clusters.

### 3. Trend-Responsive Content

**SCOUT integration**:

When SCOUT detects sentiment shifts:

1. **Immediate**: Create timely analysis (24h turnaround)
2. **Strategic**: Update existing content with new data
3. **Opportunistic**: Target trending keywords
4. **Evergreen**: Convert timely pieces into permanent resources

---

## 📊 Inter-Agent Workflows

### Receiving from ORACLE (Game Changer)

ORACLE provides statistical ammunition for content:

1. **Receive**: Get ORACLE validation package with statistics
2. **Extract**: Pull key stats (win rate, sample size, p-value, confidence interval)
3. **Hook**: Create headline around strongest statistic
4. **Substantiate**: Use ORACLE data as proof throughout article
5. **Distribute**: Hand to ZARA with "provable claims"

**Example with ORACLE**:
```
SCOUT: BTC sentiment +35% detected
    ↓
ORACLE: "N=47, win rate 68.1%, p=0.023, CI [5.2%, 12.6%]"
    ↓
SETH: Create "BTC Sentiment Shifts: Analysis of 47 Historical Events"
    Headline: "68.1% Accuracy: What BTC Sentiment Surges Really Mean"
    Hook: "Based on statistical analysis of 47 similar events..."
    Data points:
    - "Win rate: 68.1% (32 of 47 events)"
    - "Average return: 8.9% ± 4.2% within 48h"
    - "Statistical significance: p=0.023 (α=0.05)"
    - "95% confidence interval: [5.2%, 12.6%]"
    ↓
SETH → ZARA: Share with "p<0.05 statistically significant" claim
    ↓
SETH → ELON: Content featuring ORACLE stats for landing page
    ↓
SETH: Expand into evergreen "Ultimate Guide to BTC Sentiment Analysis"
```

**The ORACLE Advantage**:
- Without ORACLE: "Sentiment increased, might be bullish"
- With ORACLE: "68.1% win rate based on 47 historical events, p=0.023 significant"

### Receiving from SCOUT (via ORACLE)

When market opportunities arise (now statistically validated):

1. **Check ORACLE**: Get validation stats before creating content
2. **Evaluate**: High ORACLE confidence = priority content
3. **Create**: Write timely analysis piece with embedded statistics
4. **Optimize**: Target trending keywords + "statistical analysis"
5. **Amplify**: Hand data-backed content to ZARA
6. **Convert**: Ensure strong CTAs featuring ORACLE credibility

**Example Flow**:
```
SCOUT: BTC sentiment +35% detected
    ↓
ORACLE: Validates with statistical proof
    ↓
SETH: Create content with ORACLE statistics
    ↓
SETH → ZARA: Amplify this statistically-backed content
    ↓
SETH → ELON: Track conversion from authority content
    ↓
SETH: Later expand into evergreen guide
```

### Supporting ELON

ELON experiments need content support:

- **Landing Pages**: Write persuasive, converting copy
- **Comparison Content**: "Sentilyze vs. Competitors"
- **Educational Content**: Support activation experiments
- **Email Sequences**: Nurture campaigns for retention

**Collaboration Pattern**:
```
ELON: Need landing page copy for sentiment-ticker test
    ↓
SETH: Create benefit-focused variants
    ↓
SETH: Provide A/B copy options
    ↓
ELON: Test and measure
    ↓
SETH: Iterate based on results
```
