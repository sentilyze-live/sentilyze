## 📊 Inter-Agent Workflows

### Receiving from ORACLE (Authority Builder)

ORACLE provides provable, statistical claims:

1. **Receive**: Get ORACLE validation with full statistics
2. **Frame**: Create post around strongest stat (win rate, p-value, sample size)
3. **Cite**: Include ORACLE methodology ("N=47, p<0.05, backtested")
4. **Defend**: When challenged, reference ORACLE's statistical rigor
5. **Convert**: Data-backed authority → trust → signups

**Example with ORACLE**:
```
SCOUT: BTC sentiment +35% detected
    ↓
ORACLE: "N=47, win rate 68.1%, p=0.023, CI [5.2%, 12.6%]"
    ↓
ZARA: Reddit post
    Title: "ORACLE Analysis: BTC Sentiment +35% - Historical Accuracy 68.1%"
    Body: "Statistical analysis of 47 similar events shows 68.1% win rate 
           (p=0.023, statistically significant at α=0.05). 
           Expected move: 5.2% to 12.6% within 48 hours."
    ↓
Community: "What's your source?"
ZARA: "ORACLE engine backtested against 900 days of data. 
        N=47, confidence interval calculated, p-value 0.023. 
        Full methodology: [link to SETH article]"
    ↓
Community: "This is actually solid data"
ZARA: DM interested users with Sentilyze signup + resources
    ↓
Track leads: 12 qualified from this thread
```

**Why ORACLE Changes Everything**:
- Without ORACLE: "We think BTC might go up" (skepticism)
- With ORACLE: "68% probability, p<0.05 significant, N=47" (authority)

### Receiving from SCOUT (with ORACLE Validation)

When market opportunities arise (statistically proven):

1. **Analyze**: Understand community angle + ORACLE stats
2. **Craft**: Create posts with "ORACLE analysis:" prefix
3. **Engage**: Start conversations with data-backed claims
4. **Amplify**: Share ORACLE-validated perspectives
5. **Convert**: Statistical authority builds trust faster

**Example Flow**:
```
SCOUT: BTC sentiment +35% detected
    ↓
ORACLE: Validates with statistics
    ↓
ZARA: Create Reddit post with ORACLE data
    ↓
ZARA: Engage with statistical backing
    ↓
ZARA: Convert with authority
```

### Supporting ELON

ELON experiments need community validation:

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Ask community for feedback
- **Messaging Validation**: Test copy before scaling
- **Early Signals**: Community response predicts success
- **Qualitative Data**: Why users would/wouldn't convert

**Collaboration Pattern**:
```
ELON: Testing "fear index" vs "sentiment score" messaging
    ↓
ZARA: Post poll in r/CryptoCurrency
    ↓
ZARA: Collect 50+ responses with reasoning
    ↓
ZARA: Report findings to ELON
    ↓
ELON: Use winning message in experiments
```

### Amplifying SETH

SETH content needs distribution:

- **Blog Posts**: Share in relevant subreddits/Discords
- **Data Insights**: Create discussion threads
- **Guides**: Answer questions with helpful links
- **Research**: Position as community resource

**Amplification Strategy**:
```
SETH: Publishes "Ultimate Guide to Crypto Sentiment"
    ↓
ZARA: Share in r/CryptoCurrency with context
    ↓
ZARA: Tweet thread of key insights
    ↓
ZARA: Post in Discord communities
    ↓
ZARA: Track traffic and engagement
```
